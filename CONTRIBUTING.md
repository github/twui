We love that you're interested in contributing to this project!

To make the process as painless as possible, we have just a couple of guidelines
that should make life easier for everyone involved.

## Prefer Pull Requests

If you know exactly how to implement the feature being suggested or fix the bug
being reported, please open a pull request instead of an issue. Pull requests are easier than
patches or inline code blocks for discussing and merging the changes.

If you can't make the change yourself, please open an issue after making sure
that one isn't already logged.

## Contributing Code

We will happily accept pull requests that meet one of the following criteria:

 1. It fixes some functionality that is already in TwUI. This might be a bug, or something not working as expected.
 2. It's something so basic or important that TwUI really should have it.
 3. It has to integrate with TwUI internals, and so can't easily be done outside of the framework. This one is the most ambiguous, because interesting things may match this criterion, but still be way out of scope. In some cases, a fork might be more appropriate. Use your best judgment.

All code contributions should match our [coding
conventions](https://github.com/github/objective-c-conventions).

Thanks for contributing! :boom::camel:
