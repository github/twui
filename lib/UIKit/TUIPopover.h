// view's window moves. A positioning rectangle within the view can be
// specified for additional granularity. An anchor is used to express the
// relation between these two units of content. A popover has an appearance
// that specifies its visual characteristics, as well as a behavior that
// determines which user interactions will cause the popover to close. A
// transient popover is closed in response to most user interactions,
// whereas a semi-transient popovers is closed when the user interacts
// with the window containing the popover's positioning view. Popovers with
// application-defined behavior are not usually closed on the developer's
// behalf. All popovers will be automatically closed if the positioning view
// is removed from a window. Popovers can be detached to become a separate
// window when they are dragged by implementing a delegate method or block.
