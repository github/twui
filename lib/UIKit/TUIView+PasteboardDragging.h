@interface TUIView (Dragging)

// Returns or sets the types registered for a view. Each element of the array
// is a uniform type identifier. The returned elements are in no particular
// order, but the array is guaranteed not to contain duplicate entries.
// Registering an TUIView object for dragged types automatically makes it a
// candidate destination object for a dragging session. As such, it must
// properly implement some or all of the NSDraggingDestination protocol
// methods. As a convenience, TUIView provides default implementations of
// these methods. See the NSDraggingDestination protocol for details.
// To unregister all dragging types, set this property's value to nil.
@property (nonatomic, copy, getter = registeredDraggingTypes, setter = registerForDraggedTypes:) NSArray *draggingTypes;

// Initiates a dragging operation from the view, allowing the user to drag
// arbitrary data with a specified icon into any application that has window
// or view objects that accept dragged data. The image is the NSImage to be
// dragged. The viewLocation is the location of the image’s lower-left corner,
// in the view's coordinate system. It determines the placement of the dragged
// image under the cursor. When determining the image location you should use
// the mouse down coordinate, provided in the event, rather than the current
// mouse location. The event is the left mouse-down event that triggered the
// dragging operation. The pasteboard that is passed holds the data to be
// transferred to the destination. The source is the object that serves as
// the controller of the dragging operation. It must conform to the
// NSDraggingSource informal protocol and is typically the view itself or
// its NSWindow object. The slideBack boolean determines whether the drag
// image should slide back if it’s rejected. The image slides back to viewLocation
// if slideBack is YES and the image isn’t accepted by the dragging destination.
// If NO, the image doesn't slide back. This method must be invoked only within
// an implementation of the mouseDown: or mouseDragged: methods. Before invoking
// this method, you must place the data to be transferred on the pasteboard. To
// do this, get the drag pasteboard (NSDragPboard), declare the types of the
// data, and then put the data on the pasteboard. This code fragment initiates
// a dragging operation on an image itself (that is, the image is the data to
// be transferred).

// Initiates a dragging operation from the view, allowing the user to drag a
// file icon to any application that has window or view objects that accept
// files. The filename is a string that specifies the absolute path for the file
// that is dragged. The passed rect describes the position of the icon in the
// view's coordinate system. The slideBack boolean indicates whether the icon
// being dragged should slide back to its position in the view if the file
// isn’t accepted. The icon slides back to the initial rect if slideBack is
// YES, the file is not accepted by the dragging destination, and the user has
// not disabled icon animation; otherwise it simply disappears. The passed
// event is the mouse-down event from which to initiate the drag operation.
// In particular, its mouse location is used for the offset of the icon being
// dragged. Returns YES if the view successfully initiates the dragging
// operation (which doesn’t necessarily mean the dragging operation concluded
// successfully). Otherwise returns NO. This method must be invoked only within
// an implementation of the mouseDown: method.

// Initiates a dragging operation from the view, allowing the user to drag

// window or view objects that accept promised file data. The typeArray is an
// array of file types being promised. The array elements can consist of file
// extensions and HFS types encoded with the NSFileTypeForHFSTypeCode function.
// If promising a directory of files, only include the top directory in the array.
// The passed rect describes the position of the icon in the view's coordinate

// if slideBack is YES, the promised files are not accepted by the dragging
// destination, and the user has not disabled icon animation; otherwise it
// simply disappears. The passed event is a mouse-down event object from which
// to initiate the drag operation. In particular, its mouse location is used for
// the offset of the icon being dragged. Returns YES if the drag operation is
// initiated successfully, NO otherwise. This method must be invoked only within
// an implementation of the mouseDown: method. Promised files are files that do
// not exist, yet, but that the drag source promises to create at a file system
// location specified by the drag destination when the drag is successfully dropped.

					   slideBack:(BOOL)aFlag event:(NSEvent *)event;

// If a view decides to use dragPromisedFilesOfTypes:fromRect:source:slideBack:event:
// but also wishes to replace the image representing the promised file, the view
// can do so by overriding the dragImageForPromisedFilesOfTypes: method, and
// returning a custom image that will instead be used to represent the promised files.
// If this method returns nil, the value is not used as the dragging image.
- (NSImage *)dragImageForPromisedFilesOfTypes:(NSArray *)typeArray;

// Invoked when the dragged image enters destination bounds or frame; delegate
// returns dragging operation to perform. Returns one (and only one) of the dragging
// NSDragOperation constants. The default return value (if this method is not
// implemented by the destination) is the value returned by the previous
// draggingEntered: message. Invoked when a dragged image enters the destination
// but only if the destination has registered for the pasteboard data type involved
// in the drag operation. Specifically, this method is invoked when the mouse
// pointer enters the destination’s bounds rectangle (if it is a view object) or
// its frame rectangle (if it is a window object). This method must return a
// value that indicates which dragging operation the destination will perform
// when the image is released. In deciding which dragging operation to return,
// the method should evaluate the overlap between both the dragging operations
// allowed by the source (obtained from sender with the draggingSourceOperationMask
// method) and the dragging operations and pasteboard data types the destination
// itself supports. If none of the operations is appropriate, this method should
// return NSDragOperationNone (this is the default response if the method is not
// implemented by the destination). A destination will still receive draggingUpdated:
// and draggingExited: even if NSDragOperationNone is returned by this method.
- (NSDragOperation)draggingEntered:(id <NSDraggingInfo>)sender;

// Invoked periodically as the image is held within the destination area, allowing
// modification of the dragging operation or mouse-pointer position. Returns one
// (and only one) of the dragging operation constants described in NSDragOperation
// in the NSDraggingInfo reference. The default return value (if this method is not
// implemented by the destination) is the value returned by the previous draggingEntered:
// message. For this to be invoked, the destination must have registered for the
// pasteboard data type involved in the drag operation. The messages continue until
// the image is either released or dragged out of the window or view. This method
// provides the destination with an opportunity to modify the dragging operation
// depending on the position of the mouse pointer inside of the destination view
// or window object. For example, you may have several graphics or areas of text
// contained within the same view and wish to tailor the dragging operation, or
// to ignore the drag event completely, depending upon which object is underneath
// the mouse pointer at the time when the user releases the dragged image and the
// performDragOperation: method is invoked. You typically examine the contents of
// the pasteboard in the draggingEntered: method, where this examination is performed
// only once, rather than in the draggingUpdated: method, which is invoked multiple
// times. Only one destination at a time receives a sequence of draggingUpdated:
// messages. If the mouse pointer is within the bounds of two overlapping views
// that are both valid destinations, the uppermost view receives these messages
// until the image is either released or dragged out.
- (NSDragOperation)draggingUpdated:(id <NSDraggingInfo>)sender;

// Invoked when the dragged image exits the view's bounds rectangle.
- (void)draggingExited:(id <NSDraggingInfo>)sender;

// Implement this method to be notified when a drag operation ends in some other
// destination. This method might be used by a destination doing auto-expansion
// in order to collapse any auto-expands.
- (void)draggingEnded:(id <NSDraggingInfo>)sender;

// Invoked when the image is released, allowing the receiver to agree to or
// refuse drag operation. Returns YES if the receiver agrees to perform the drag
// operation and NO if not. This method is invoked only if the most recent
// draggingEntered: or draggingUpdated: message returned an acceptable drag-operation
// value. If you want the drag items to animate from their current location on
// screen to their final location in your view, set the sender object’s
// animatesToDestination property to YES in your implementation of this method.
- (BOOL)prepareForDragOperation:(id <NSDraggingInfo>)sender;

// Invoked after the released image has been removed from the screen, signaling the
// receiver to import the pasteboard data. If the destination accepts the data,
// it returns YES; otherwise it returns NO. The default is to return NO. For
// this method to be invoked, the previous prepareForDragOperation: message must
// have returned YES. The destination should implement this method to do the real
// work of importing the pasteboard data represented by the image. If the sender
// object’s animatesToDestination was set to YES in prepareForDragOperation:,
// then setup any animation to arrange space for the drag items to animate to.
- (BOOL)performDragOperation:(id <NSDraggingInfo>)sender;

// Invoked when the dragging operation is complete, signaling the view to perform
// any necessary clean-up. For this method to be invoked, the previous
// performDragOperation: must have returned YES. The destination implements this method
// to perform any tidying up that it needs to do, such as updating its visual
// representation now that it has incorporated the dragged data. This message is the
// last message sent from sender to the destination during a dragging session. If the
// sender object’s animatesToDestination property was set to YES in
// prepareForDragOperation:, then the drag image is still visible. At this point you
// should draw the final visual representation in the view. When this method returns,
// the drag image is removed form the screen. If your final visual representation
// matches the visual representation in the drag, this is a seamless transition.
